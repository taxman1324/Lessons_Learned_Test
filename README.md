# This is the Lessons Learned Test repository!
In this area we are able to show what the plan is for this repository and how we plan to use the tool.

# We can make different sections depending on the need
In this case we can make a list describing the actions new members can take to get more acquainted:
1. They can check out the boards to see how others have used the tool
2. They can create a new issue and find the best spot for it
3. They can brainstorm and create new boards and projects that suit their needs
